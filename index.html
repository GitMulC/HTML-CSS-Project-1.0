        <h1 id="what-title">What is Magic: The Gathering?</h1>
        <p>
            Magic: The Gathering is a tabletop collectible card game created by game designer Richard Garfield in 1993. 
            Currently, Magic: The Gathering is owned by Wizards of the Coast a company which still produces magic cards to this day.
            In a game of magic, you are playing as a planeswalker, a mythical being who travels across the multiverse of Magic, visiting different planes of existence and gathering mana 
            from the land in the process.
            You gather mana in its 5 most basic forms: White mana from plains, Blue mana from islands, Black mana from swamps, Red mana from mountains, and Greeen mana from forests. 
            Using this mana cast spells, summon creatures, enchant your enemies and friends, all in order to defeat your opponent(s).
            Magic is all about making intracate decks, casting crazy spells and having fun with the people sitting across from you at the gamne table. 
            With over 20,000 unique card designs and well over 100 sets and expansions released to date, Magic: The Gathering is <b>THE</b> best tabletop collectible card game out there!
            So lets gather some cards, sling some spells, and get this started!

        <h2>How to Play Magic</h2>
        <section>
            The object of any game of magic is to reduce the life total of your opponent to zero. Last one standing wins! 
            The most important rule in Magic is that for every rule, there is a card or mechanic, or ruling out there which is the exception! 
            Speaking of which, you can also win a game of magic if an opponent runs out of cards in their library. 
            In magic, your deck is called your library and if you go to draw from it without any cards in it you automatically lose the game. 
            So with these win conditions in mind lets teach you how to play Magic: The Gathering!

         <h3>Your First Turn</h3>
            The first thing you need to know about how to play magic is the structure of every turn. Every turn in Magic has the same basic structure:
            <ol>
                <li>Beginning: Untap, upkeep, draw.</li>
                <li>Main Phase: Play a land, cast creatures, sorceries and any other spells.</li>
                <li>Combat: Declare attackers, opponent declares blockers, combat damage is dealt.</li>
                <li>Post Combat Main Phase: Another main phase. Don't forget to play your land if you haven't already!</li>
                <li>End Step: Creatures heal, pass the turn to your opponent.</li>
            </ol>  
        </section>
        <section>
         <h3>Lands and Mana</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When it's your turn play a land card (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest). You may play only 1 land per turn. 
                    Note that playing a card is different from casting a card. Casting means you spend mana to play the card. Playing is something you do free of mana.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To extract and use mana from these land cards, tap it (turn it sideways or diagonal to indicate this). 
                    This will add mana to your mana pool depending on how many lands you tapped. Mana empties out of your pool between phases so keep this in mind.
                    For example 4 red mana added to your pool in your main phase will remain in your mana pool until you move to the next phase, which is combat.
                    That 4 red mana will not be there to use in the combat phase, and your lands will remain untap until the beginning of your next turn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using this mana you want to cast the other cards in your deck. Every card that isn't a land is a spell, which you must use mana to cast.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Spells and Card Types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Any card with a mana cost on it is a spell. Casting spells with mana is the core gameplay mechanic of every game. Without mana you can't cast any spells,
                    and without spells you can't use your mana. Resource management is the name of the game for your spells!
                </li>
                <li>
                    The main types of cards in magic are permanents. These are cards which stick around and stay on the battlefield after they're cast or played. 
                    These are artifacts, creatures, lands, enchantments, and planeswalkers.
                </li>              
                <li>
                     The other card type is nonpermanent spells called instants and sorceries. These cards have an effect as soon as they're cast. 
                     Instants can be cast at anytime you want even during your opponents turn, but sorceries can only be cast on your turn.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Creatures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Creatures are the most common permanent card you'll come across. When creatures first hit the battlefield, they succomb to what's called summoning sickness.
                    This means that they can't attack an opponent until your next turn. Creatures can also block other creatures attacking you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In magic, the easiest and most common way of reducing your opponents life total is by attacking your opponent with your creatures. 
                    Creatures can also attack planeswalker cards, but not specific creatures.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Enchantments and Planeswalkers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Enchantments are permanents that kind of act like sorceries. They can be better in certain situation and can provide static effects for you. 
                    Think of them as permanent sorceries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Planeswalker cards are permanents that have crazy powerful effects. Planeswalkers are defacto allies and can be attacked by opposing players creatures.
                    They can have really strong static abilities and powerful final abilities called ultimates which can tip the scales in your favour if you invest in them.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Zones</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Graveyard: The graveyard is where cards go when they're removed from the battlefield (from combat damage or any other damage) or are sent there by a specific effect. 
                    Instants and sorceries go there right after they're cast and their effect is finished.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exile: Exile is a zone which basically means it's outside of the game. 
                    This is a more penultimate zone than the graveyard, as tonnes of cards in magic allow you to retrieve or play cards from the graveyard.
                </li>
