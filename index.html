        <h1>What is Magic: The Gathering?</h1>
        <p> 
            Magic: The Gathering is a tabletop collectible card game created by game designer Richard Garfield in 1993.
            Currently, Magic: The Gathering is owned by Wizards of the Coast a game publishing which still produces magic cards
            to this day.
            In a game of magic, you are playing as a planeswalker, a mythical being who travels across the multi-verse
            of Magic, visiting different planes of existence and gathering mana
            from the land in the process.
            You gather mana in its 5 most basic forms: White mana from plains <img src="assets/images/white-mana.svg" alt="white mana symbol" class="white">,
            Blue mana from islands <img src="assets/images/blue-mana.svg" alt="blue mana symbol" class="blue">, 
            Black mana from swamps <img src="assets/images/black-mana.svg" alt="black mana symbol" class="black">, 
            Red mana from mountains <img src="assets/images/red-mana.svg" alt="red mana symbol" class="red">, 
            and Greeen mana from forests <img src="assets/images/green-mana.svg" alt="green mana symbol" class="green">.
            Using this mana cast spells, summon creatures, enchant your enemies and friends, all in order to defeat your
            opponent(s)!
            Magic is all about making intracate decks, casting crazy spells and having fun with the people sitting
            across from you at the game table.
            With over 20,000 unique card designs and well over 100 sets and expansions released to date, Magic: The
            Gathering is <b><u>THE</u></b> best tabletop collectible card game out there!
            So lets gather some magic cards, sling some spells, and get this started!

        <h2>How to Play Magic</h2>
        <p>
            The object of any game of magic is simple. Reduce the life total of your opponent to zero. Last one standing
            wins.
            The most important rule in Magic is that for every rule, there is a card or mechanic, or ruling out there
            which is the exception to that rule!
            Speaking of which, you can also win a game of magic if an opponent runs out of cards in their library.
            In magic, your deck is called your library and if you go to draw from it without any cards in it you
            automatically lose the game. So, as you can see there are already exceptions to the winning rule!
            So with these win conditions in mind lets teach you how to play Magic: The Gathering!
        </p>

            <h3>Your First Turn</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing you need to know about how to play magic is the structure of every turn. Every turn in
                Magic has the same basic structure:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Beginning: Untap all your cards, upkeep, draw a card off the top of your library.</li>
                <li>Main Phase: Play a land, cast creatures, sorceries and any other spells.</li>
                <li>Combat: Declare attackers, opponent declares blockers, combat damage is dealt to creatures and opponents.</li>
                <li>Post Combat Main Phase: Another main phase. Don't forget to play your land if you haven't already!</li>
                <li>End Step: Creatures heal, pass the turn to your opponent.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Lands and Mana</h3>
            <p>
                When it's your turn play a land card (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest). You may play only 1
                land per turn.
                To extract and use mana from these land cards, tap it (turn it sideways or diagonal to indicate this).
                This will add mana to your mana pool depending on how many lands you tapped. Mana empties out of your
                pool between phases so keep this in mind.
                For example 4 red mana added to your pool in your main phase will remain in your mana pool until you
                move to the next phase, which is the combat phase.
                That 4 red mana will not be there to use in the combat phase, and your lands will remain untap until the
                beginning of your next turn.
                Using this mana you want to cast the other cards in your deck. Every card that isn't a land is a spell,
                which you must use mana to cast.
                Note that playing a card is different from casting a card. Casting means you spend mana to play the
                card. Playing is something you do free of mana. You play lands, and you cast spells.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Spells and Card Types</h3>
            <p>
                Any card with a mana cost on it is a spell. Casting spells with mana is the core gameplay mechanic of
                every game. Without mana you can't cast any spells,
                and without spells you can't use your mana. Resource management is the name of the game for your spells!
                The main types of cards in magic are permanents. These are cards which stick around and stay on the
                battlefield after they're cast or played.
                These are artifacts, creatures, lands, enchantments, and planeswalkers.
                The other card type is nonpermanent spells. These are mainly instants and sorceries. These cards have an effect as
                soon as they're cast.
                Instants can be cast at anytime you want, even during your opponents turn, but sorceries can only be cast
                on your turn.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Creatures</h3>
            <p>
                Creatures are the most common permanent card you'll come across. When creatures first hit the
                battlefield, they succomb to what's called summoning sickness.
                This means that they can't attack an opponent until your next turn. Creatures can also block other
                creatures attacking you.
                In magic, the easiest and most common way of reducing your opponents life total is by attacking your
                opponent with your creatures.
                Creatures can also attack planeswalker cards, but not specific creatures. When attacking with your creatures, you declare attacks on an opponent or a planeswalker, 
                not an enemy creature.
            </p>

            <h3>Damage</h3>
            <p>
                Damage is a vital mechanic to know when playing a game of magic. Damage reduces life totals and creatures toughness. 
                It can be dealt in the form of creatures attacking player, or in the form of sorceries and instants. 
                When a creatue is dealt damage but not killed it will remain on the battlefield and heal at every end step.
                Damage can be prevented with spells and counter magic.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Counterspells</h3>
            <p>
                In magic an spell can be countered using counter spells. A counter spell prevents a spell from hitting the battlefield or having its effect. 
                Creatures, enchantments, instants, planeswalkers, and sorceries can all be countered. You cannot counter someone from playing a land or from paying a cost in a spell though.
                Counter spells are overwhemingly instants, as they need to respond to powerful spells cast on opponents turns. Blue spells house the most counterspells,
                so keep an eye out for the blue player on your table!
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Stack</h3>
            <p>
                Speaking of counter spells, the stack is a vital concept to understand when interacting with other players spells.
                In magic when a spell is cast it goes on the stack. if nobody else plays any other spells, the spell resolves and hits the battlefield or its effect happens. 
                While on the stack, a spell can be responded to by any other player. They must simply declare "In response...." and cast there spell.
                Then there spell goes on the stack on top of the spell they're responding to. 
                So, that means that the most recent spell cast (the one on top of the stack) is the first to resolve. 
                The spell cast before it (the one below it on the stack), then resolves, and so on until all spells on the stack resolve.
            </p>

            <h3>Enchantments and Planeswalkers</h3>
            <p>
                Enchantments are permanents that kind of act like sorceries. They can be better in certain situations and
                can provide static effects for you.
                Think of them as permanent sorceries.
                Planeswalker cards are permanents that have crazy powerful effects. Planeswalkers are defacto allies and
                can be attacked by an opposing players creatures.
                They can have really strong static abilities and powerful final abilities called ultimates which can tip
                the scales in your favour if you invest in them.

            <h3>Zones</h3>
            <p>
                Graveyard: The graveyard is where cards go when they're removed from the battlefield (from combat damage
                or any other damage) or are sent there by a specific effect.
                Instants and sorceries go there right after they're cast and their effect is finished.
                Exile: Exile is a zone which basically means it's outside of the game.
                This is a more penultimate zone than the graveyard, as tonnes of cards in magic allow you to retrieve or
                play cards from the graveyard.
