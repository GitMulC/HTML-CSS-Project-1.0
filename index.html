        <h1>What is Magic: The Gathering?</h1>
        <p>
            Magic: The Gathering is a tabletop collectible card game created by game designer Richard Garfield in 1993. 
            You play as a planeswalker, a mythical being who travels across the multiverse of Magic, visiting different planes of existence and gathering mana in the process. 
            You gather mana in its 5 basic forms: White mana from plains, Blue mana from islands, Black mana from swamps, Red mana from mountains, and Greeen mana from forests. 
            Using this mana cast spells, summon creatures, all in order to defeat your opponent(s).
            Magic is all about making intracate decks, casting crazy spells and having fun with the people sitting across from you. 
            With 20,000 unique card designs and well over 100 sets and expansions released to date, Magic: The Gathering is THE best tabletop collectible card game out there!
            So lets gather some cards, and get this started!

        <h1>How to Play Magic</h1>
        <p>
            The object of a game magic is to reduce the life total of your opponent to zero. Last one standing wins! Simple enough right? With the basic principle of Magic out of the way, it's time to address the more complicated stuff! 
            The most important thing in Magic to know is that for every rule we're going to tell you, there is a card or mechanic out there which is the exception!
        </p>   
           <ul>
               <li>Shuffle your deck (or library as it's called in Magic), and draw 7 cards.</li>
               <li>Every turn in Magic has the same structure:
                   <ol>
                       <li>Beginning: Untap, upkeep, draw.</li>
                       <li>Main Phase: Play land, cast creatures, sorceries and any other spells.</li>
                       <li>Combat: Declare attackers, opponent declares blockers, combat damage is dealt.</li>
                       <li>Main Phase (Post Combat Main Phase): Another main phase.</li>
                       <li>End Step: Creatures heal, pass the turn to your opponent.</li>
                   </ol>
               </li>
               <li>When it's your turn play a land card (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest). You may play only 1 land per turn.</li>
               <li>To extract and use mana from these land cards, tap it (turn it sideways or diagonal to indicate this). This will add mana to your mana pool depending on how many lands you tapped an what color they are.</li>
               <li>Using this mana you want to cast the other cards in your deck. Every card that isn't a land is a spell, which you must use mana to cast. The main types of cards are permanents. These are cards which stick around and stay on the battlefield after they're cast or played. These are creatures, lands, enchantments, and planeswalkers.</li>              <li>The other type of card are instants and sorceries. These cards have an effect as soon as they're cast. Instants can be cast at anytime you want, sorceries can only be cast on your turn. After these cards are cast and the effect occurs they go straight to the graveyard.</li>
               <li>The graveyard is where cards go when they're removed from the battlefield (from combat damage or any other damage) or are sent there by a specific effect. Instants and sorceries go there right after they're cast.</li>
            </ul>
