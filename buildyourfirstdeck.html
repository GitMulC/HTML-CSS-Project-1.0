    <h3>Magic: The Gathering Formats</h3>
    <p>
        Before we go over building your first ever magic deck you'll need to know which format you want to play. Magic has a multitude of formats available, each with its own rules.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <h4>Formats in Magic:</h4>
        <li>
            Standard: 1 vs 1 with 20 being your starting life total. 
            This format uses the most recent sets and expansions. It is one of the most heavily featured formats in competitive magic. Deck size is 60 cards minimum. 
            It's a constructed format meaning you make your own deck.
        </li>
        <li>
            Modern: One of the more compeitive formats, Modern features cards with the "modern" card frame. These are all sets after Eighth Edition. 
            Like Standard you start at 20 life and play 1 vs 1. Deck size is 60 cards minimum. Modern is also a constructed format.
        </li>
        <li>
            Commander: One of the most popular formats. It is aimed at casual players. It features a Commander or General. 
            This is the leader of your deck and dictates what colours can be used in the deck. It has a competitive play and become widely popular since its inception. 
            Deck size is 100 cards including your Commander. Commander is a constructed format.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pauper: This format has you only using cards with the common rarity. Like Commander this is a casual format that has seen a rise in popularity over the years. 
            Deck size is 60 cards minimum and this is a constructed format.
        </li>
        <li>
            Draft: Darft has you open packs from a specific set and play with the cards you open. Deck size depends on how many packs each player gets. This is not a constructed format.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Building your First Deck</h4>
    <p>
        As you can see, there are so many formats in magic, that building your deck depends very much on the format you want to partake in. 
        Our recommendation is that you build a casual 60 card deck to start off.
        Besides Commander (which can only have one of each card), a deck can only have 4 copies of the same card. But, and this is true for every single format, 
        you may have as many basic lands in your deck as you want.
        A key thing to remember about deck building is, what do you want your deck to do? You've got to know how you want to win. 
        At the same time you're going to need to interact with your opponent(s). So spells that stop your opponent from winning before you do are also needed.
        You'll also need card draw to get the cards you want to win.
        First decide your win condition and then once it's a fully fledged idea add in secondary things like card draw and interaction.
