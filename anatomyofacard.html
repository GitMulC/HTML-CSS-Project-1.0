        <p>
            Here we have a classic magic card. This card is a creature spell called Korvold, Fae-Cursed King. 
            We're going to break this card down into bit sized chunks to help you in your understanding of Magic: The Gathering.
        </p>

    <section>
        <img src="assets/images/mana-cost.jpg" alt="mana cost of korvold fae-cursed king">
        <h3>1. Mana Cost</h3>
        <p>
            This is the most important part of every magic card. This is how much the card costs. You should always look at the mana cost at the card before you look at anything else.
            In this particular cost, we need one black mana, one red mana and one green mana.
            The 2 in grey is generic mana, meaning any colour can be used to pay for the remaining two. So 2 of any other colour can be used.
            In total this spell costs 5 mana to cast. The way we would say this in magic, is that this spell has a converted mana cost of 5 mana. 
            Always be weary of the lands you have in hand and on the battlefield. 
            A good rule of thumb in any game of magic, is to keep an opening hand which has enough lands/mana sources to cast everything in your hand.
            It's also worth noting that mana costs indicate colour identity. White cards have white mana costs (and generic), blue cards have blue mana costs and so on and so forth.
            But in Korvold, Fae-Cursed King you see that the card is distinctly gold. A gold card means that the card is multi-coloured, meaning it is a black, red, and green card.
            Card colour can factor into a lot of spells so it's important to know what's the colour identity of a card. 
            In the singleton formats such as commander, that only cards of the same colour as your commanderare allowed in your deck.

        <img src="assets/images/card-type.jpg" alt="card type of korvold fae-cursed king">
        <h3>2. Card Type</h3>
        <p>
            This section tells us the type and sub-type of the card. In this example we have a legendary creature card,
            with a sub-type of Dragon Noble. A card with the legendary type in it means that it represents a unique person or object within the magic multi-verse. 
            Creature cards tend to have the most types and sub-types due to there being so many creature types in magic.
            Other cards such as lands, can have their own types. Lands can be basic, land or even a specific basic such as a forest swamp land.
            Card types are often overlooked but it is important to note them as some spells will target a specific card type and not others. 
            For insstance, cards can search your library for forest cards, meaning you can take any land card with the forest typing in it, which includes dual lands with a forest typing.

        <img src="assets/images/rules-text.jpg" alt="rules text of korvold fae-cursed king">
        <h3>3. Rules Text</h3>
        <p>
            After mana cost and card type, this is <b>THE</b> most important part of the card. This is the rules text
            and tells you what the card does, what its abilities are and anything else the card can do. Take your time
            to read and understand this part of every card you draw! You'll find key words, symbols, and other rulings in this section of the card.
            Always do exactly what the card says. So if a creature cards rules text say that it is indestructible, this means that any and all effects that could destroy it, won't.
            But, there are ways around this. Effects that reduce a creatures toughness to 0 or less will result in it dying and going to the graveyard.
            So you can see why understanding all the text in this section is key to playing and winning magic.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/images/power-toughness.jpg" alt="power and toughness of korvold fae-cursed king">
        <h3>4. Power & Toughness</h3>
        <p>
            This part of the card is only found on creature cards. On the left you have the creatures power, this is how
            much damage it can deal. On the left is the creatures toughness, how much damage the creature can take before it is destroyed. When
            any creatures toughness is brought to 0 or lower it dies and is sent to the graveyard. Note that in combat damage is dealt simaultaneously, 
            so the attacking creature deals damage at the exact same time as the defending creature does. So 2 creatures with power toughness 2/2 will kill each other.
            But a 2/2 vs a 4/4, will result in the 4/4 winning but his  toughness will be reduced to 2 until the end of the turn.
            So there will be some math to do to fully grasp Magic: The Gathering!

        <img src="assets/images/flavour-text.jpg" alt="flavour text of korvold fae-cursed king">
        <h3>5. Flavour Text</h3>
        <p>
            Flavour text is always found below the rules text and in italics. It can be a quote, a saying or a line from
            a book. It's purpose is to contextualise or give some lore or background to a card. It's often tied to the
            storyline from where the particular card comes from. In Korvold, Fae-Cursed King our flavour text is referring to Korvold being cursed and turned from a human into a dragon.
            Korvold is a minor character found in the Throne of Eldraine set and isn't as important to the story as this card would have you believe. 
            But that's the thing about flavour text, it doesn't impact the game at all and comes down to taste and personal preferance. 
            Flavour text can also have a good amount of easter eggs, from in-game references, to quoting real world stories and poetry.

        <img src="assets/images/card-artwork.jpg" alt="artwork of korvold fae-cursed king">
        <h3>6. Artwork</h3>
        <p>
            This the artwork which illustrates a card. Within the last few years, Wizards of the Coast has introduced cards in every set with alternate artwork or even expanded art.
            Like flavour text these changes and alterations have no impact on actualy gameplay, but for some formats such as commander you'll find people with decks full of alternate art.
            You can also hire an artist to alter a specific card of your choosing to any artwork you would like.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Name</h3>
        <img src="assets/images/card-name.jpg" alt="name of korvold fae-cursed king">
        <p>
            The name of the card, pretty straight forward.

        <h3>8. Rarity Symbol</h3>
        <img src="assets/images/rarity-symbol.jpg" alt="rarity symbol on korvold fae-cursed king">
        <p>
            The rarity symbol signifies how rare the card is. Korvold, Fae-Cursed King is a mythic rare card, so you
            know it is a pretty powerful card. Gold is rare, slightly less powerful but can still be pretty strong.
            Blue-ish grey is uncommon, and black symbol is common.
